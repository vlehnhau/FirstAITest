# 5-in-a-Row AI Player

This project implements an AI player for the game of 5-in-a-row using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The AI makes intelligent moves based on evaluating the game board, aiming to maximize its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's opportunities.

## Features

- Implements the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient decision-making.
- Evaluates possible moves based on a scoring system that accounts for both the player's and opponent's tokens.
- Supports a 10x10 game board.
